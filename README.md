# Cricket for Americans

Since July 2013 I've been writing posts that attempt to explain the game of cricket to an American audience (or anyone familiar with baseball, actually). Although the posts are on Medium, I've set up this site as a table of contents. Feel free to let me know what you think [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/derekwillis) or by emailing dwillis AT gmail.
